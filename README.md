# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

The task is to create an application that accepts a title as a parameter. The application should then return book results, and for each book should display the following information:
Title
Book Cover
Author
Published Date

The application should also have the ability to: 
Sort results alphabetically by title
Sort results by more recently published
Any other functionality you feel will make this app a better experience
