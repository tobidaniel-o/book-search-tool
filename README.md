# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

The task is to create an application that accepts a title as a parameter. The application should then return book results, and for each book should display the following information:
Title
Book Cover
Author
Published Date

The application should also have the ability to: 
Sort results alphabetically by title
Sort results by more recently published
Any other functionality you feel will make this app a better experience

##### Answers to the tech questions

1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? 
   Answer - I spent ~10hrs in the spate of two days.

2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
    Answer - If I had more time, I would make it persistent.

3. If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
    Answer - I would spend more time on the UI design, making it beautiful and more appealing to the eyes. :)

4. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
    Answer:
      1. I would track down a performance issue in production by using the Chrome Performance Tab.
      2. Or using, the Profiler from React Chrome plugin DevTools.
      3. Lastly, using the React Profile API.

5. How would you improve the API that you just used?
    - Answer:
      1. I observed that some books have mutliple names for the same author, I believe that's a bug. If so, I would improve the API by fixing that issue.
      2. Another area of improvement for the API would be to fix some data with missing cover, author name and published date. 

6. Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
    - Answer: Please find this in the [myself.json] file.
